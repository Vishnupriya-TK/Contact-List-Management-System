# 📞 Contact List Management System

A simple and user-friendly web application to manage your contacts. This app lets you add, search, delete, and clear contact entries, all in your browser — with no backend or database required. Built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**, the app uses **Local Storage** to preserve data even after refreshing the page.
