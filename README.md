- 🔍 Search contacts by name or mobile number
- 🗑️ Delete individual contacts
- ♻️ Reset the entire contact list
- 💾 Data is stored in Local Storage for persistence
- 📱 Mobile responsive design

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (with Google Fonts)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation & Local Storage API)

3. Add a contact by entering a name and phone number, then clicking **"Add"**.
